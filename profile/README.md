# HELLO, WORLD!

This organization is an attempt to gather all available documentation and resources related to the [Foenix Retro Systems](https://c256foenix.com/) brand of new retro computers.

When possible, repositories are cloned into the organization so they can be traced back to the original owner, while keeping everything in one place. Development will not take place here, unless the original repository is abandoned and no longer accepts pull requests.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
